          <p class="paragraph-light">THIS GROUP WAS CREATED AFTER A TRAGIC &quot;DHOKA&quot; in our college . so let us tell you about the dhoka ,Once upon a time, in a college far away, two boys named Aadya and Atharva were assigned to work on a project for their upcoming competition. They were excited to participate in the contest, but they knew that it would take a lot of hard work and dedication to win. They were both intelligent and creative, but they lacked the resources to complete the project on their own. One day, they met three tiny women who offered to help them with their project. Aadya and Atharva were delighted to have found such enthusiastic collaborators, and they quickly accepted their offer. The women were small in stature. They didn&#x27;t worked at all with Aadya and Atharva to develop their project. As the competition drew nearer, Aadya and Atharva became more confident in their chances of winning. They had poured their hearts and souls into the project, and they knew it was the best they could do. However, their happiness was short-lived. On the day of the competition, they discovered that the three tiny women had betrayed them.The women had secretly made an alliance with another boy, who was in charge of the competition. They had provided him with all the information about Aadya and Atharva project, including its weaknesses and vulnerabilities. The boy then used this information to sabotage Aadya and Atharva project during the competition, causing them to lose.Aadya and Atharva were devastated. They couldn&#x27;t believe that the three tiny women they had trusted had turned against them. They felt betrayed and hurt by their actions. The women had left them for another boy, who had offered them a better deal. Aadya and Atharva learned a valuable lesson that day. They realized that not everyone they met could be trusted, no matter how helpful they seemed. They vowed to be more cautious in the future and to never let their guard down. They also knew that they had to work harder and smarter than ever before to succeed in the future. Despite the betrayal, Aadya and Atharva remained optimistic. They knew that they had given their best effort, and that was all that mattered. They were proud of what they had accomplished, and they were determined to continue pursuing their dreams. The main objective of the project is to promote literacy and education by creating an e-library accessible to all. Through the use of technology, the project aims to bridge the digital gap and provide equal access to knowledge resources. Additionally, the project aims to develop and incorporate advanced features of LanguageChain to further support language and cultural diversity.e-Library: The e-library will serve as a platform for students, teachers, and the general public to access learning resources. It will include a wide range of materials, including books, journals, and videos, covering various subject areas. This will enhance learning outcomes and make education available to all.</p>
